# Voice_control

This is a android app for controlling an Arduino based Robot connected via bluetooth through voice commands.
This is made with the help of MIT App Inventor.

It works such as the voice command is given by clicking the mic button and then it is converted to a string which is then transmitted to the arduino via bluettoth module.
